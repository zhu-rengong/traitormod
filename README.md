__**The Traitor Mode**__

> Evil Factory's Traitor Mod is a server-sided mod that overrides the vanilla traitor mode. If a round starts with enough players, some crew members may be selected as traitor and receive new objectives to prevent the rest of the crew from achieving their mission. The traitors are selected by a weight system, assuring that players who have not been traitors so often will be more likely to be chosen. 
> Captains and Security Officers are always loyal to the ship and need to work together to find and restrain all traitors so the crew can complete their mission.

__**The Points System**__

> Whenever a player gains a skill point, he also gains an amount of points. Traitors gain additional points by completing their objectives. Non-Traitor crew gains points by completing their missions and reaching the end of the level. 
> Points will be persistently stored on the server and accumulate over rounds. If a player dies a number of times the amount of points will be reduced. Players can gain lives back by completing their missions.
> On every round half of a player's points will be given the character as experience and can be used to pick talents.

__**Pointshop**__
> All crewmates have access to the pointshop where they can buy basic resources and other things. Traitors get access to a special menu in the pointshop where they can buy things to assist in their mission. Spectators have access to the death spawn menu in the pointshop, where they can spawn as monsters.
It's also possible to buy new ships in the pointshop, but that requires you to have OverrideRespawnSub set to true in config.lua.

__**Ghost Roles**__
> Ghost Roles allows dead spectators to take control of things like pirates, and some monsters, like the watcher and the mudraptor pet.
